# Changelog

## Unreleased

- change: product name and identity are now Fastab (`app.fastab`, `Fastab.app`, CLI `ftab`, PTY `fastabterm`). Fastab is a separate product from Easy Complete and can sit beside it: install, uninstall, repair, IME, HIToolbox, and data dirs no longer consume, rewrite, or remove Easy Complete. Telemetry UI is hidden and reporting stays unconfigured. Issue template, SECURITY, NOTICE, and hidden `ftab telemetry status` now use Fastab / default-off.
- change: Fastab does not steal `ec://`, retarget `ec`/`ecterm`, copy Easy Complete settings or sqlite, or drop the Easy Complete IME palette. `ftab init` stands down when `Q_TERM` is already set so it will not nest inside `ecterm`. Both completion desktops in the same terminal is not supported.
- fix: doctor drops Auth / WebView host checks. Accessibility copy is Fastab-only. IME uninstall writes HIToolbox in-process. Website download structured data pins the versioned DMG.
- fix: dual-install no longer fights Easy Complete for first/last rc position, no longer truncates shared fish `00_fig_pre.fish` on desktop migrate, and does not steal the current Non Keyboard IM. Doctor treats an `ecterm` session as a sibling wrap instead of an outdated Fastab PTY. `pre.fish` copies `Q_SET_PARENT` the same way as `pre.sh`. Uninstall no longer whole-domain-imports HIToolbox.
- fix: the updater product name is Fastab only and no longer treats an Easy Complete update feed as its own.
- fix: leftover Fig CLI hints (`fig settings` / `fig update` / `fig launch` / `fig issue`) and doctor “Qterm” copy now use `ftab` / `fastabterm`. `ftab launch` says Settings, not dashboard. WebView-era `/help` and `/autocomplete` deep links open About and Behavior.
- fix: doctor and uninstall no longer scan or delete Fig’s `withfig.fig-*` VS Code / Cursor extensions. Fastab does not ship one.

## v3.0.0-beta.16

- perf: typed hook IR is parsed on first use; catalog provenance is dropped and the sidecar bytes are reused at snapshot open
- perf: file path listings use dirent file type (still follow symlink directories) and cache Fig `matches` regexes
- perf: figterm intercept IPC is sent only when a session's flags change; other tabs still unlock
- perf: VS Code / Cursor keep the xterm caret cache on the focused helper textarea instead of walking the window on every key
- ci: bundled specs freshness uses `--check` without rewriting the tree; unused workspace crates are skipped; the dist profile smokes on main only

## v3.0.0-beta.15

- fix: rustup `+nightly toolchain uninstall` / `target remove` keep the uninstall and remove listings
- fix: shared native adapters read keys, values and flags from their call site
- fix: hook `undefined` / `null` output is an empty suggestion list, not a conversion error
- ci: the 50ms hook-baseline watchdog no longer flakes timeout against immediate error; the npm session fixture stays keystroke-shaped

## v3.0.0-beta.14

- feat: desktop app has zero runtime JavaScript — completion hooks are typed IR or named native adapters; QuickJS, `rquickjs`, and `hooks/` are gone
- fix: generator `splitOn: ""` no longer splits script output into lines, and split pieces keep their exact text instead of being trimmed one by one
- fix: dynamic `alias` / `loadSpec` / `generateSpec` hooks honour the live `autocomplete.scriptTimeout` setting instead of a fixed 5 s
- fix: a hook loop is stopped by the script budget as it runs, not only at its next command, and a hook that runs out of budget is logged as a timeout instead of a failure
- fix: a missing `specs-ir` directory fails closed instead of silently serving an empty spec registry; the engine rebinds specs and hook modules together after an install so an in-flight request cannot read a mixed generation
- build: bundled spec source and compiled IR are published as one verified pair; the `.app` is assembled from locked snapshots of that pair and swapped into place atomically
- build: completion hooks compile to `typed-hooks.json` (typed IR + adapters); leftover `hooks/` / `source-modules/` fail the compile, audit, and CI publish gate

## v3.0.0-beta.13

- fix: long selected suggestion titles scroll more slowly at a bounded speed, ease into each turn, and pause at both ends

## v3.0.0-beta.12

- fix: file and folder generators use the parser value of quoted or backslash-escaped paths; plain-name and path Tab/Enter insertions edit inside a simple closed quote instead of after it
- fix: native suggestion-list refreshes keep the selected row in view without turning mouse-wheel scrolling into a snap back to the first row
- fix: missing Accessibility still opens the native settings repair path on silent or login-item launches
- ci: release builds check that the tag, Cargo, website, and built app versions match; prereleases avoid the stable Sparkle feed and offer GitHub Releases for manual updates

## v3.0.0-beta.11

- fix: mouse-wheel on the suggestion list no longer flashes and snaps back to the first row
- fix: overflowing suggestion titles ping-pong instead of jumping from the tail back to the start

## v3.0.0-beta.10

- fix: Down on `cd ~/` scrolls past the first history rows instead of sticking on a 5-row window
- fix: quoted path Tab/Enter no longer doubles the directory (`'src/src/foo/`)
- fix: `?` shortcut palette after `&&` or an assignment still deletes `? `
- fix: custom generators receive the full parser token as `context.searchTerm`
- fix: history frequency boosts spec rows via alias spellings (`co` → checkout)
- fix: `{cursor}` execute no longer sends an extra return
- fix: backspacing a trailing space hides until the next keystroke

## v3.0.0-beta.9

- fix: after Enter-accepting a completion with no new argument, do not re-show the accepted row when the shell ack has a drifted caret

## v3.0.0-beta.8

- fix: Tab on `git ch` no longer inserts a trailing backslash from history prefixes (`git checkout\`)

## v3.0.0-beta.7

- change: Finish Setup keeps the Input Method row and labels it optional

## v3.0.0-beta.6

- change: Grant Accessibility copy names the macOS 27 System Settings list Device Control and Data Access; macOS 26 still uses Accessibility, and the deep link stays `Privacy_Accessibility`
- change: check required permissions before showing settings, keep Input Method optional, and stop Fix All / first-run from opening the Keyboard input-method pane

## v3.0.0-beta.5

- fix: show the Accessibility grant card only after System Settings has a stable window; ignore repeat Grant while waiting

## v3.0.0-beta.4

- fix: grant drag preview snapshots the live icon-and-name row from its layer so rounded fill and Retina scale match the card

## v3.0.0-beta.3

- fix: Grant Accessibility drops a stale System Settings list row so the current binary can be dragged in
- fix: the grant drag preview is an icon-and-name chip, with Retina scale and dark-mode contrast

## v3.0.0-beta.2

- feat: grant Accessibility from Easy Complete Settings with a drag-to-list card beside the system pane; launch, install, tray, and revoke no longer open System Settings or the TCC sheet
- fix: file and folder titles hide the already-typed directory (`cd ~/xx/`); branch names keep the full path (`git merge feat/`)
- feat: settings control for leftover overflow after that strip — scroll the selected row, or ellipsis
- fix: Enter on `~` inserts `~` and does not execute the command

## v3.0.0-beta.1

- feat: replace the completion theme grid with a dropdown and a single live preview; offer the same 12 theme choices for the settings interface and completion popup.
- fix: keep the settings sidebar and switches at a stable width on every page; refresh navigation, page headings, grouped controls, and completion theme previews.
- change: move this fork to the independent 3.0 version line and use `codeime/easy-complete` as the default update source, so upstream releases do not replace this build.
- feat: separate the settings interface theme from the completion theme; completion previews now show command suggestions using the popup's actual palette.
- feat: update bundled completion specs to `@chen86860/autocomplete-specs@3.1.0`, adding 19 commands and refreshing Claude, Codex, and Copilot suggestions.
- feat: add a native settings switch for the menu bar icon and reopen settings when Easy Complete is launched again, including when the icon is hidden.
- fix: render menu bar icons at Retina resolution and give app icons consistent transparent margins while preserving this fork's artwork.

## v2.3.0

- ci: publish an ad-hoc ARM64 DMG to GitHub Releases when Developer ID or Sparkle secrets are missing, and allow a first release without Sparkle deltas
- fix: `scripts/install.sh` no longer wipes the Accessibility grant on every build that changes the desktop binary. It assumed a new ad-hoc signature always invalidates the grant and ran `tccutil reset` up front, but macOS 26 re-pins the TCC row to the new cdhash by itself (`TCC.db` held the fresh hash with auth_reason "System Set" after two in-place swaps, and the app came up trusted), so the reset only threw away a working grant and sent the user to System Settings after each install. The script now launches the new app first and asks it (`ec debug accessibility status`, the desktop process's own `AXIsProcessTrusted()` over its socket); it resets and re-prompts only when that answer is a repeated `false`, which is what older releases that keep the stale requirement still report, and prints a hint instead of resetting when the app cannot be reached
- fix: the desktop process no longer leaks an Accessibility object on every attribute it reads. `UIElement::get_attr_ref` wrapped the result of `AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue` — a `Copy`-rule call that already hands over +1 — under the *get* rule, so each value was retained twice and released once. Reading `kAXChildren` pinned every child element with the array, and the xterm caret walk (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, …) reads one per element on every keystroke it cannot resolve: a Cursor session held 211k `AXUIElement`s, 72 MB of heap and a 131 MB footprint after a few minutes of typing, growing ~10 KB per key. The same rule is now applied to the caret query's `AXValueCreate` and `AXBoundsForRange` results, the `AXUIElementCreateApplication` elements built on activation and element destruction, and the `AXObserver`, which was never released and leaked one observer plus a mach port per app switch. Measured on the same 800-key drill: +57 elements per key before, 0 after, footprint flat at ~50 MB. Pinned by retain-count and source tests in `macos-utils`
- fix: the desktop process no longer livelocks at 100% CPU after a few hours of typing, with the overlay frozen on `···`. `NSApplication::run` was hosted inside a single `tokio::Runtime::block_on` poll that never returns, and `block_on` fixes tokio's cooperative budget (128 units) for the life of that poll. Every completion reply that resolved on the main thread spent one; from the 129th on, `tokio::sync::oneshot::Receiver::poll` reported Pending and woke itself at once, and GPUI's executor re-queued the task onto the main queue it was already draining. The engine's reply channel is now `futures::channel::oneshot` (no budget accounting, pinned by a test that drives 200 replies inside one `block_on` poll), and `main` starts GPUI after `block_on` returns, holding only `Runtime::enter()` so `Handle::current()` keeps working from AppKit callbacks
- fix: schedule the overlay frame drain with a one-frame delay instead of `exec_async` — GCD keeps servicing blocks queued from within the running main-queue drain, so a duplicate frame request that slips past the geometry dedupe could re-enter the drain in the same turn. A source pin keeps every frame dispatch on `exec_after`. (This was first shipped as the fix for the 100% CPU hang above; it was not, but the hazard is real)
- change: replace the autocomplete WebView and dashboard WebView with GPUI — the overlay and settings window are native views; completions run in `ec_engine` from build-time JSON IR, with QuickJS only for spec hooks (`postProcess`, `script`, `custom`, `generateSpec`)
- fix: place the overlay using `NSScreen.screens[0]` as the global-coordinate origin, not `mainScreen` — on an external display `mainScreen` is the focused screen and the popup landed at the wrong height
- fix: clear the `···` loading marker when the request that turned it on finishes, even if that result is stale, and retire it after `autocomplete.scriptTimeout` (default 6s) instead of the 30s engine watchdog — the request keeps running, so a slow generator still gets rendered when it answers
- fix: retry the same edit buffer after a failed completion — the guard that stops repeated buffer notifications from restarting an in-flight request used to latch on a failure, leaving the line permanently without suggestions
- fix: after a timed-out generator, rebuild the engine from the cached spec index instead of walking the specs directory again
- fix: pass the shell's process name and environment variables to spec `custom` generators, which received an empty context and silently changed their suggestions
- fix: honour a generator's `splitOn` ahead of its `postProcess` hook, matching Fig's own order for specs that declare both
- fix: treat Tab as a full acceptance when the shared prefix already spells out the selected row, so the trailing space and separator are inserted as they are on Enter
- fix: keep the list down after backspacing a whole token away, and after a paste or a shell history recall — the next keystroke brings it back
- change: Accessibility permission opens System Settings only — the drag-to-authorize coach was removed
- chore: delete the leftover WebView sources (`packages/autocomplete-app`, `packages/dashboard-app`), which had not been loaded since the GPUI migration; the bundled icon list they carried now lives in `specs.config.json`
- chore: delete the Rust side of the WebView bridge — the `fig://`, `ecresource://` and `spec://` protocol handlers, the request handlers behind them, and most of `fig_desktop_api`, none of which had a WebView to answer since the GPUI migration. Two watchers that fired into a window that no longer exists went with them, as did 14 dependencies of `fig_desktop` and 16 of `fig_desktop_api`. A crate-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]` had been hiding all of it
- chore: stop copying `bundle/specs` into the `.app` — the engine has resolved `specs-ir` only since the IR compiler landed, and the spec icons are embedded into the binary at build time, so that 28 MB tree was shipped without ever being opened. The installed app drops from 109 MB to 81 MB and the DMG from 25 MB to 22 MB
- docs: document the GPUI overlay, IR engine, QuickJS hooks, and `scripts/memory-usage.sh`

## v2.2.2

- fix: order shell history suggestions most-recent-first — history is read oldest-first and deduplication kept the earliest occurrence, so typing `git` put a long-forgotten command at the top of the list instead of the `git status` run a minute earlier. History argument values now follow the same order

## v2.2.1

- fix: ignore caret positions reported without a usable rectangle, which input method clients send once their window is gone — the all-zero rectangle resolved to the screen origin and pinned the suggestion popup to the corner of the primary display, so on a multi-monitor setup it appeared on a different screen than the terminal
- fix: hide the suggestion popup when focus moves between elements of one window in VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other Electron terminals — clicking the editor, the sidebar, another terminal pane, or closing a terminal tab changes neither the focused window nor the active application, so the popup used to stay on screen until something else happened to hide it
- fix: drop the cached terminal caret element when focus moves, so the popup no longer anchors itself to the pane the user just left
- fix: check the Accessibility permission on every launch instead of once per version, so a same-version reinstall no longer leaves the app silently inert — replacing the bundle invalidates the grant while leaving the checkbox in System Settings ticked
- feat: show a warning and a repair entry in the menu bar when the Accessibility permission is missing, which is the only surface a silent launch has, and refresh it as soon as the permission is granted or revoked

## v2.2.0

- fix: stop resizing the autocomplete window when the requested size is unchanged, and stop collapsing it to 1x1 while hidden — both made WKWebView replace its backing graphics surfaces, so memory grew with every keystroke and every show/hide cycle
- fix: rebuild the hidden autocomplete webview once it gets old or has absorbed a very large number of resizes, releasing the graphics surfaces WebKit retains, and drop the fixed 24-hour page reload it replaces
- change: relicense the project under the MIT License alone, ship `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and a generated `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` inside the app bundle, and verify that payload during the release build
- feat: add an Open Source Licenses entry to the dashboard's About section that opens the bundled license files
- change: restore AppKit's native traffic-light placement and realign the dashboard sidebar around it, with tighter nav rows and macOS-style section labels
- build: upgrade React to 19, zustand to 5, ESLint to 10, the Protobuf stack to Buf 2.13 / Prost 0.14, and the rest of the Rust and TypeScript dependency tree
- docs: add a documentation hub, per-terminal setup guides for Ghostty, Otty, kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, Zed, and iTerm2, and Simplified Chinese versions of the main site pages
- change: move the privacy policy to `/privacy-policy` (the old URL redirects), give each page its own sitemap `lastmod`, and declare hreflang alternates for the translated pages

## v2.1.1

- fix: show shell history in the suggestion list again when History Mode is left at its default — the dashboard displayed "Show with completions" while the setting had never been written, and the code treated the unset value as off
- fix: stop sending an empty terminal session id from `Process.run`, which arrived as `Some("")` and failed UUID parsing host-side, silently leaving the zsh, bash, and fish history sources empty on every launch
- fix: derive the current shell from the edit buffer context instead of the pre-exec `processDidChange` notification, so history is available before the first command of a session is run
- fix: recompute suggestions when a history source finishes loading, instead of leaving the list without history until the next keystroke or settings change
- fix: fall back to the recorded history database when the shell-specific source is unavailable, matching the existing behaviour for history argument suggestions
- change: replace the history suggestion emoji with a rotate-clock glyph on a rounded tile, matching the icon style of the surrounding suggestions
- change: turn Hide Immediately Execute into a positive Show Immediately Execute toggle, so enabling it reveals its sub-options rather than hiding them
- change: render sub-settings as an indented inset group following macOS System Settings, and drop descriptions that only restated their label
- change: token the dashboard palette into semantic CSS variables so light and dark mode stay in sync

## v2.1.0

- change: shell integration now stands down entirely when the desktop app is not running, so VS Code Terminal Suggest, Otty, and other terminals keep their own completions. This is decided when the shell starts, so a terminal opened before the app is running stays uninstrumented for that session — open a new terminal after launching Easy Complete
- fix: subscribe to macOS accessibility notifications correctly in release builds, where undefined behaviour previously made every subscription report failure and left the popup unable to follow the focused window
- fix: keep tracking a window when it rejects only some accessibility notifications, instead of abandoning the whole application
- fix: stop observing Easy Complete's own windows, which made showing the popup look like an app switch and hid it again immediately
- fix: restore first-token command completion, sourcing aliases and the full PATH from a login shell with a 1.5s budget and an automatic non-login fallback
- fix: convert `Process.run` timeouts to protobuf `Duration` with the correct millisecond-to-nanosecond factor
- fix: preserve framework symlinks when installing to `/Applications` so the bundle passes `codesign --verify --deep --strict` and the Sparkle updater stays valid
- feat: add Otty and ChatGPT (Codex) terminal support, including input-method cursor tracking for Otty and xterm.js caret detection for Codex
- feat: coexist with Otty-managed shell rc files instead of reporting the integration as broken when Otty owns the end of the file
- feat: add a silent launch setting that starts the app in the background without opening the settings window
- feat: expose the auto-execute row as a parent toggle with trailing-space and dangerous-command sub-options, and add a first-token completion toggle
- feat: build the autocomplete and dashboard webviews on demand and release them when idle, and apply `autocomplete.keepReady` changes without a restart
- feat: localize the settings UI with English and Simplified Chinese, and add the Claude Light autocomplete theme
- fix: prevent dangerous suggestions from reaching the auto-execute row through the current-token fallback path
- change: disable autocomplete WebView DevTools in release builds and opt out of the macOS AutoFill helper
- build: honour `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` when assembling the app bundle
- fix: patch the open npm advisories in both lockfiles and cover the standalone website project with Dependabot

## v2.0.50

- fix: preserve Sparkle-generated delta files by normalizing their space-based filenames before appcast cleanup, and fail releases when delta assets are missing or mismatched
- change: simplify the `ec` command surface by removing obsolete `setup` and `theme` commands, hiding internal commands, and adding version and project information to help output
- fix: make `ec issue` use GitHub's standard title/body URL, route `ec update` through the native Sparkle updater, and install shell integration through the supported integrations command
- build: replace the broken pnpm 11.13.0 pin with pnpm 11.14.0 so local and release builds can complete

## v2.0.49

- feat: add an official `chen86860/homebrew-tap` Cask so Easy Complete can be installed with one Homebrew command
- docs: make Homebrew the recommended installation path in the English and Chinese READMEs and on the website, while retaining the signed DMG as a manual alternative

## v2.0.48

- fix: keep only the current release item and its referenced delta files in the Sparkle appcast, preventing stale update entries from pointing at assets that are not uploaded with the new release
- change: make the settings window feel more native by disabling browser context menus, Inspect Element, and chrome text selection in production while preserving editable-field selection and full inspector access in local debug builds

## v2.0.47

- fix: restore the proven React 18, react-window 1, and Zustand 4 autocomplete runtime after the v2.0.46 migration prevented the suggestion panel from opening on terminal input
- change: keep the compatible Vite 8, Vitest 4, and broader build-tool upgrades while returning the autocomplete list, resize observer, and state updates to their stable implementations
- fix: correct the local installer repository and build-script paths so it assembles and installs the app from the repository root
- feat: add installation, troubleshooting, Ghostty, and Fig-alternative website guides with route-specific SEO metadata
- test: validate the rollback with production builds, lint, 177 passing tests, and an installed-app terminal smoke test

## v2.0.46

- change: upgrade the frontend runtime and build stack to React 19, Vite 8, Vitest 4, TypeScript 6, Zustand 5, Zod 4, and react-window 2, while keeping Tailwind on the latest Safari 15-compatible v3 release
- change: replace the React 18-only resize-observer wrapper with the native browser API, migrate list virtualization and stricter Zustand state updates, and align dashboard inputs and hooks with React 19 behavior
- chore: refresh compatible lint, formatting, codegen, and workspace dependencies; remove deprecated types and unused lint plugins; migrate Vitest workspace configuration; pin patched transitive dependencies so the dependency audit is clean
- test: validate the upgrade on Node 22.23.1 with repeated full builds, coverage tests, and shuffled test ordering (177 tests passing)

## v2.0.45

- fix: render path-backed file and folder suggestion icons as real images, with built-in icon fallbacks when local icon loading fails
- change: modernize the embedded webviews to a Safari 15 target, remove legacy browser/polyfill dependencies, and align local and CI tooling on Node 22.23.1 with pnpm 11.13.0
- change: make the macOS distribution pipeline ARM64-only end to end; remove obsolete universal/Linux/Windows Makefiles and Linux packaging assets, strip Intel slices from Sparkle before signing, and reject non-ARM binaries during app and DMG assembly
- chore: remove deprecated or unused frontend types and dependencies, prune the lockfile, quiet API request code generation, and correct the CLI crate/binary names in the README files

## v2.0.44

- feat: replaced the unconditional macOS LaunchAgent with a user-controlled launch-at-login integration: macOS 13+ now uses `SMAppService.mainAppService`, while macOS 12 keeps a non-`KeepAlive` LaunchAgent fallback
- fix: synchronized the Launch at Login setting with the actual system registration, migrated and removed both historical LaunchAgents, kept login launches silent, and made uninstall fully unregister every startup entry
- change: set macOS 12 as the explicit minimum deployment target in both the Rust build and the app bundle metadata
- chore: migrated formatting from nightly-only rustfmt options to the pinned stable toolchain, updated CI/setup/docs, and mechanically reformatted the Rust workspace

## v2.0.43

- fix: deliver webview emit events even while the autocomplete window is disabled, so settings changes such as the autocomplete theme take effect immediately while the dashboard is focused instead of remaining stale until restart
- fix: keep the Dashboard on its native macOS accent color when switching themes; the theme setting now affects only the autocomplete dropdown
- chore: remove unused upstream `figterm` / `fig-api` test harnesses, the standalone shell-startup profiler, and the stale model ZIP Git LFS rule; none were wired into this fork's CI or workspace

## v2.0.42

- feat: simplified the settings panel from five sections to three (Appearance, Behavior, About) — History settings now live in a card inside Behavior, and the Advanced tab is gone
- feat: removed rarely-used and dangerous options from the settings UI (auto-executing dangerous commands / git aliases, run-after-space, script timeout, and other niche toggles); all of them remain configurable via `ec settings`
- feat: restructured the About page — issue reporting now sits inside Troubleshooting next to the `ec doctor` diagnostic, GitHub / Release Notes moved to a footer above the license line, the version badge copies version info on click, and descriptions were tightened throughout
- feat: the dashboard window now uses native macOS vibrancy with window-focus-aware styling
- change: the default theme is now `github-dark`, and Launch at Login defaults to off

## v2.0.41

- feat: expanded the anonymous telemetry event set — `daily_heartbeat` (active-device tracking, sent at most once per 24h), `integration_installed` (with an `integration` property), `app_uninstalled` (reported by `uninstall.sh`), and an `is_startup` property on `app_opened` to distinguish login-item launches from manual opens
- feat: high-frequency autocomplete events (`autocomplete_shown` / `autocomplete_accepted`) are now aggregated locally in SQLite and reported in bulk as `count_*` properties of the daily heartbeat — one request per day instead of one per keystroke
- feat: telemetry events now carry `shell` (login shell) and `terminal` (best-effort emulator detection) as common properties
- fix: telemetry events that fail to send are persisted to an offline queue (`telemetry_queue.jsonl`, capped at 200 events, original timestamps preserved) and retried on the next launch or next successful send, instead of being silently dropped
- fix: the telemetry HTTP client now sends an `easy-complete/<version>` User-Agent — UA-less requests were blocked outright by Cloudflare bot protection in front of the analytics proxy
- fix: registered the previously dangling `ec telemetry` subcommand (`enable` / `disable` / `status`, plus a hidden `track` used by install/uninstall scripts); CLI-origin events now await delivery before the process exits
- fix: the dashboard "Report an issue" link now points to the repository issues list instead of the template chooser

## v2.0.40

- fix: updated bundled completion specs to `@chen86860/autocomplete-specs@3.0.7`, fixing the `pnpm` spec runtime import crash that prevented the autocomplete dropdown from opening for `pnpm`
- test: the upstream specs package now smoke-imports built spec files after compilation, so top-level runtime errors in generated specs fail before they can ship downstream

## v2.0.39

- feat: updated bundled completion specs to `@chen86860/autocomplete-specs@3.0.6`, refreshing standard-library specs such as `bun`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `rush`, `yarn`, and keeping the existing `aws` / `az` exclusions
- chore: manage `@chen86860/autocomplete-specs` as a root npm devDependency pinned by `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`; `sync-bundled-specs.mjs` now reads the installed package from `node_modules` by default instead of downloading a tarball from the npm registry

## v2.0.38

- perf: excluded the `az` (Azure CLI) namespace from bundled completion specs alongside the existing `aws` exclusion, shrinking `bundle/specs` from ~40MB to ~31MB (most users never touch either cloud CLI)
- docs: split the changelog into an English `CHANGELOG.md` and a Chinese `CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md`, matching the existing `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` convention; `scripts/bump-version.sh` and `CLAUDE.md` now remind you to add an entry to both files on every release

## v2.0.37

- feat: updated bundled completion specs to `@chen86860/autocomplete-specs@3.0.5`, adding built-in specs for `bash`, `corepack`, `pbcopy`, `sha256sum`, `sleep`, `xattr`, and refreshing standard-library specs such as `brew`, `bun`, `copilot`, `gh`

## v2.0.36

- feat: updated bundled completion specs to `@chen86860/autocomplete-specs@3.0.4`, refreshing `claude`, `dynamic`, `gemini`, `pnpm` specs

## v2.0.35

- perf: added a `dist` release build profile (thin LTO + `codegen-units=1` + `strip` + `panic=abort`), substantially shrinking distributed binaries (e.g. `ec` 18.9MB → 8.6MB) without slowing down local `cargo run --release` iteration
- perf: removed dead code / debug-only polyfills from the autocomplete overlay's main bundle (`@juggle/resize-observer`, `util`, `deep-object-diff` are now dynamically loaded on demand or inlined), shrinking the main chunk from 632KB to 545KB
- ci: added a smoke build for the `dist` profile to surface release-build-specific issues (`panic=abort`/LTO/strip) earlier

## v2.0.34

- feat: bundled completion specs now sync from the npm package `@chen86860/autocomplete-specs`, replacing the old GitHub release zip update flow
- feat: updated bundled completion specs to `@chen86860/autocomplete-specs@3.0.3`, continuing to derive `index.json` from the actual file tree to preserve diff-versioned specs such as `dynamic`

## v2.0.33

- feat: updated bundled completion specs to the `spec-build-number-0.4.0` release of `chen86860/autocomplete-specs`, refreshing standard-library specs such as `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `dynamic`

## v2.0.32

- feat: updated bundled completion specs to the `spec-build-number-0.3.0` release of `chen86860/autocomplete-specs`, adding standard-library specs such as `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `uvx`
- fix: added a fallback for named Fig icons in the command palette that aren't covered by bundled resources, fixing blank document icons for suggestions like `pnpm dev` package.json scripts

## v2.0.31

- fix: fixed named `fig://icon?...` icons in the command palette being incorrectly rewritten into invalid static asset paths, which left some commands with a blank placeholder instead of an icon
- test: added regression tests for command palette icon URL conversion to ensure named Fig icons and external URLs are no longer mishandled

## v2.0.30

- fix: the release appcast now generates up to 8 deltas by default and pulls the 8 most recent stable releases as Sparkle archive input, covering more upgrade paths from older versions to the latest
- fix: kept appcast delta URLs consistent with GitHub release asset filenames, preventing Sparkle from falling back to the full DMG due to delta 404s

## v2.0.29

- fix: the dashboard now explicitly activates the macOS app when opened from the menu bar or a second launch, avoiding an occasional issue where "show desktop" was triggered and pushed the window into a corner

## v2.0.28

- feat: Fuzzy Matching in settings now defaults to on; both the settings page and the autocomplete runtime default to fuzzy search enabled when the user hasn't written a value to config
- chore: added a shared default-settings entry point to prevent the settings page's displayed state from diverging from actual autocomplete behavior

## v2.0.27

- feat: shipped the repo cleanup and CI quality gate as a stable release, including removal of a duplicate autocomplete package, Easy Complete branding/release metadata cleanup, and PR CI gate plus Rust/JS test fixes
- fix: the release workflow now applies stricter SemVer prerelease detection for `alpha` / `beta` / `rc` tags, preventing prerelease versions from leaking into the stable Sparkle appcast

## v2.0.27-beta.1

- prerelease: shipped the large-scale repo cleanup and CI quality gate on a beta tag first, to avoid pushing it directly into stable users' Sparkle latest update channel
- chore: removed the duplicate autocomplete package, standardizing on `packages/autocomplete-app`
- chore: cleaned up leftover upstream branding in the Easy Complete fork's package metadata, release copy, product paths, and test snapshots
- ci: added PR/main-branch quality gates covering JS build/lint/test, website build, and Rust fmt/clippy/test

## v2.0.26

- feat: the Sparkle release pipeline now supports delta updates: release CI keeps the stable DMG download entry point while also generating a versioned Sparkle full-update DMG, pulling recent historical releases as archive input, and uploading `appcast.xml` plus `.delta` update packages
- docs: updated the Sparkle release documentation with delta update CI behavior, local generation commands, and the release assets that need to be uploaded

## v2.0.25

- feat: updated bundled completion specs to the `spec-build-number-0.2.0` release of `chen86860/autocomplete-specs`, and regenerated the bundled `bundle/specs`

## v2.0.24

- feat: added `info!`-level logging to the auto-update path (scheduled-check arming, Sparkle framework loading, updater ready and disabling auto-download, manual/background check triggers, activating the app before the scheduled update prompt) — previously everything was logged only at `debug!` while `fig_log` defaulted to ERROR, leaving no logs to diagnose with; the full auto-update timeline can now be observed with `Q_LOG_LEVEL=info`
- fix: changed the tray's "update unavailable" message from the misleading _"Sparkle.framework is not bundled in this build"_ to an accurate description (the updater failed to start: framework missing or initialization failed, see logs for detail)

## v2.0.23

- fix: found the real root cause of auto-update still "not working" — when a background check found a new version, Sparkle's `automaticallyDownloadsUpdates` (leftover `SUAutomaticallyUpdate` default of YES) triggered a **silent download and install**, but this app is ad-hoc signed with `SUEnableInstallerLauncherService` disabled, so the privileged install could never complete — resulting in neither a prompt nor a successful install (only manual checks could prompt). Now `setAutomaticallyDownloadsUpdates: NO` is explicitly set after creating the updater, forcing background checks to show a prompt, and the dirty default is self-healed by rewriting it on every launch
- fix: added `ECSparkleUserDriverDelegate` (`SPUStandardUserDriverDelegate`) so that scheduled-check prompts for the `LSUIElement` menu-bar agent appear immediately in front, instead of being deferred by Sparkle's gentle-reminder behavior — `standardUserDriverShouldHandleShowingScheduledUpdate…` returns `YES`, and `willHandleShowingUpdate` calls `activateIgnoringOtherApps:`

## v2.0.22

- feat: completion specs are now fetched from Releases on the self-maintained fork [`chen86860/autocomplete-specs`](https://github.com/chen86860/autocomplete-specs) (its CI compiles `src/*.ts` and publishes `specs.zip`); `sync-bundled-specs.mjs` downloads the zip and derives `index.json` from the file tree itself; the old per-file CDN sync is kept as a fallback
- feat: the spec source is now **pinned to a fixed release tag** (`SPECS_TAG`, defaulting to `spec-build-number-0.1.0`) rather than `latest`, so builds are reproducible and never change silently; overridable via `BUNDLED_SPECS_TAG` / `BUNDLED_SPECS_RELEASE_ZIP`
- docs: updated the Bundled Specs section in CLAUDE.md to describe the new source and version-pinning mechanism

## v2.0.21

- perf: trimmed the bundled completion specs — `sync-bundled-specs.mjs` added `BUNDLED_SPECS_EXCLUDE` (defaulting to excluding `aws`), filtering both the on-disk files and `index.json`; bundle size dropped from ~76 MB to ~40 MB (AWS CLI specs are ~36 MB / 419 entries and most users never trigger them)
- feat: the bundled `Info.plist` now includes `LSApplicationCategoryType` (app category) and `NSHumanReadableCopyright` (copyright notice), with the copyright year auto-generated and overridable via the `COPYRIGHT` environment variable
- chore: regenerated `icon.icns`, `AppIcon.iconset`, and per-size icon PNGs from the source `icon.png` so all three stay in sync
- chore: removed `bundle/dmg/VolumeIcon.icns`, which wasn't referenced by any build script
- docs: added a "Bundled Specs" section to CLAUDE.md describing the specs build/exclusion mechanism and the no-network-fallback runtime behavior

## v2.0.20

- fix: fixed auto-update "not detecting automatically" — as an `LSUIElement` background agent, the app couldn't show Sparkle's first-run authorization dialog, which silently disabled scheduled checks; the updater now explicitly sets `setAutomaticallyChecksForUpdates: YES` after creation, and the bundled `Info.plist` declares `SUEnableAutomaticChecks` and `SUScheduledCheckInterval` (1 day)
- feat: added a Troubleshooting card to the settings panel's About page, guiding users to run `ec doctor` in the terminal for diagnostics (the command can be copied with one click)

## v2.0.19

- feat: added the `fig_telemetry` crate, wiring up PostHog telemetry (install count, open count, version distribution), injected via compile-time environment variables `POSTHOG_ENDPOINT` / `POSTHOG_API_KEY`, silently disabled when unconfigured
- feat: reported events now include `app_name`, `app_version`, `os_version`, and an anonymous `device_id` to distinguish clients
- feat: added a telemetry notice section and toggle at the bottom of the onboarding permission gate (enabled by default)
- feat: added a telemetry toggle entry point in the settings panel's About → Privacy card
- feat: the GitHub Actions release workflow now supports injecting telemetry configuration via repository secrets
- fix: fixed auto-update-check failures — `SPUStandardUpdaterController` is now created via `exec_async` on the main thread, and the background check on startup is delayed 5 seconds to ensure the event loop is ready

## v2.0.18

- fix: the dashboard now shows a loading state during the permission check on startup, avoiding a flash of the permissions page
- feat: added a Shell Integration install step to the permission gate, fixing the issue where `.zshrc` wasn't auto-injected after a fresh DMG install; only actionable once accessibility permission is granted
- fix: `ec doctor` warning messages (bash/zsh dotfile check) now show the check item name, matching the error format
- fix: the `ec doctor` terminal integration check no longer prints a meaningless empty `Q_TERM=` line, showing the specific version number instead when there's a version mismatch
